							<h4>Agenda: Combatting the ISIS in Iraq and Syria</h4>
							
							</p>
							<p>
							In recent history, the Middle East has been a hotbed of violence, instability and religious conflict. 
							The leading cause of this instability and violence has been the sectarian divide between the Sunnis and the Shias. 
							After the death of its founder, Muhammad, the religion of Islam split into two sects: The Sunnis and the Shias. 
							The Sunnis believed that the next leader should be elected from a selection of worthy candidates, whereas the Shias believed that the next leader and the ones following him must be descendants of Muhammad.
							Islam split into two sections with very different views and visions for Islam and its future. Over time, the animosity between Sunnis and Shias has become more extreme.
							In recent history, there have been many instances of a particularly dominant Sunni or Shia group which wants to use a radical route to spread its sectarian version of the Islamic faith and its beliefs across the world. 
							Most of them have been very similar in their approach using risky suicidal missions to garner attention in the world and to passively persuade fellow Muslims to join the ‘Islamic cause’. 
							</p>
							<p>
								
							The Al Qaeda, the Taliban and many other such terrorist organisations have dominated global headlines and also the main dialogue of the United Nations on terrorism and extremism. However, the ISIS is nothing like what we have seen before. 
							It doesn’t portray itself as any other terrorist organisation, but rather likes to reckon itself to a state: The Islamic State. 
							It has a functional bureaucracy, an army which is led by former military commanders and also has an economic and social agenda. 
							It is a caliphate, which is proving to be much more organised, structured and ambitious than the normal Islamic extremist organisation.
							 The ISIS believes in spreading Islam throughout the world, not through propaganda and terrorism, but by annexation and rule. 
							 Over the past year, the ISIS has had substantial gains in Iraq and Syria. 
							 Even now, with a multi country coalition engaged in fighting the ISIS, the gains made by the ISIS prove that defeating the ISIS is not going to be any mean feat. 
							 It would require substantial planning, co-operation and vision to destroy this organisation and once again establish peace in the war torn Iraq and Middle East.

                    		The Disarmament and International Security Council also referred to as the First Committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations, deals with challenges and threats to world peace, advancing the security of the international community.
							It considers all disarmament and international security matters within the scope of the Charter or relating to the powers and functions of any other organ of the United Nations; the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments; promotion of cooperative arrangements and measures aimed at strengthening stability through lower levels of armaments.
							The First Committee sessions are structured into three distinctive stages:
							<ol>
							<li>General debate</li>
							<li>Thematic discussions</li>
							<li>Action on drafts</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Agenda 1: Defining policies related to stockpiling bio-chemical weapons</h4>
							The danger posed by Biological Weapons (BW) and Chemical Weapons (CW) still lingers two decades after the cold war’s end. Despite the reduction of threats as an increasing number of states fulfill their commitments under international conventions, a small number of states still maintain declared and undeclared stockpiles and even active BW and CW programs. A bio-technology revolution is making bio-technology more readily available and presents a potential future proliferation risk. Dual-use chemical processes also present a series of ongoing challenges. Progress has certainly been made by Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) state-parties and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the destruction of declared CW stockpiles. However, progress on the implementation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) has been slower due to the lack of a formal verification mechanism.

							<h4>Agenda 2: Discussing the role of PMSCs in the privatisation of war.</h4>
							PMSCs are private business companies that provide military and/or security services, irrespective of how they describe themselves. Military and security services include, in particular, the provision of armed guards and the protection of persons and objects, such as convoys, buildings and other places; maintenance and operation of weapons systems; prisoner detention; and advice to, or training of, local forces and security

                    		<h4> Agenda 1: Children in armed conflict </h4>
							Today any state crisis is not just limited to the loss of infrastructure, combatants and mere civilians. The changing nature of these conflicts has lead to children finding their safe havens in frontline, holding a gun. Thus,Children in armed conflict is a grave concern for humanitarians as it has multiple psychological and physical impacts that scars their future hideously. In light of all the events that happened in the past and could happen, the human rights council aims to reduce the repercussion on children. After all they are CHILDREN, NOT SOLDIERS
							<br>
							<h4> Agenda 2: Violation of Humanitarian rights in Middle Eastern Countries post the Syrian crisis </h4>
							Post the civil war crisis in Syria, Many ordinary Syrian people have been been forced to leave their homes to escape to safety in other countries.Every day refugees stream across the borders of Syria into the neighbouring nations .More than 3 million people have fled Syria since the start of the conflict, most of them women and children. It is one of the largest refugee movements in recent history.A further 6.5 million people, 50% of them children, have had to leave their homes within Syria.They are in desperate need of help. UNHRC recognises this post war crisis and urges member nations to come together and battle this humanitarian crisis together. At the end of the day , only humans can help humans.

                    		<h4> Agenda 1: Maritime crime and Piracy </h4>
							
								When you think of a Pirate you think of Captain Jack Sparrow or Captain Hook, however modern day pirates are sightly different from what we see in films, though their agendas are similar in nature.
								And so, Maritime crime and piracy in the 21st century includes the criminal activity directed at vessels or maritime structures and the use of the high seas to perpetrate transnational organized crimes such as smuggling of persons or illicit substances.
								Maritime crimes such as piracy or drug smuggling can have devastating human consequences as over 90% of global trade is carried out by sea, the economic effects of maritime crime can be crippling..
							    The Gulf of Aden, The Indian Ocean and The Somalian Basin are known for their notorious piracy that has been on a rise in recent years. 
								Thus, due to the unique nature of the high seas - falling outside the jurisdiction of any single state, but within the collective responsibility of all - a coordinated and comprehensive approach must be taken to tackle crimes both occurring at sea and being carried out through use of the maritime domain.  This includes interrupting criminal activities at sea, strengthening domestic maritime law-enforcement capacity, and addressing the root causes of maritime crime on land.
								<br>
							<h4> Agenda 2: 	Narco-Terrorism </h4>
								Narco-terrorism is the activity of terrorist organizations that engage in drug trafficking activity to fund their operations and gain recruits and expertise or the attempts of narcotics traffickers to influence the policies of a government or a society through violence and intimidation, and to hinder the enforcement of anti-drug laws by the systematic threat or use of such violence. A very common and widely known example would be that of Pablo Escobar’s, who led the Medellin drug cartel, violence in his dealings with the Colombian government that included a series of assassinations, hijackings and bombings. In today's world organizations like Colombian FARC who was the main catalyst behind Colombia’s 34%nationwide increase in cases of massacres with around 2,500 civilian kidnappings in July 2005 during its four decade reign of terror, and the Taliban in Afghanistan, among others, are considered to use narcotic and illicit drugs trafficking as a way to finance their actions.

							Welcome to the World Health Organization at Podar Model United Nations 2015! 
							You are all part of one of the specialized agencies of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations known as the World Health Organization (WHO) which deals with the International Public Health in order to ensure the basic necessities of life and a healthy standard of living is delivered to the entire world.  
							At PMUN 2015, the committee will be discussing the following topics:

                    		<h4> Agenda 1: 1.	Establishing and Implementing an International Framework for Disease Prevention and Aid Supply: </h4>
							
								<p>During times of a natural calamity or a humanitarian crisis, the international society can join hands together with considerable strength, but still there is no specific framework to adequately fund the everyday projects dealing with sudden disease outbreaks that aren’t in the media spotlight. There is an urgent need for a streamlined process to deliver aid and international attention. </p>
<p>
Therefore, the WHO seeks to establish a strong framework that will adequately deal with the question of national sovereignty while effectively bringing in the required aid to help combat the easily preventable diseases at the earliest possible in the current developing nations. 
</p>


								<br>
							<h4> Agenda 2: Conducting risk assessments before major sporting events </h4>
								<p>Public health is an important factor when planning a mass gathering such as major sport events (for e.g., the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup). </p>
<p>Water bodies for the upcoming Rio 2016 Olympics boating and swimming have been found to be contaminated with human feces. The tests conducted reveal dangerous levels of viruses and bacteria being present in the waters. If a disease breaks out, the effects can be massive and widespread as there are going to be a huge number of spectators.</p>
<p>In 2012, five members from the Australian and Canadian Badminton teams were infected with food poisoning in London. Tests revealed the virus Norovirus was present in their food. Though the three Australian members recovered, the remaining Canadian members were forced to miss a warm-up match.</p>

                    	This committee is a recreation of the Lok Sabha house of the Indian parliament. 
						The Lok Sabha is the lower house of the Bicameral Indian parliamentary system, however has the most power when it comes to legislative decisions. 
						We endeavour to emulate the proceedings of the Lok Sabha as accurately as possible, therefore, get ready for two days of intense debate involving yelling, shaking of fists, chair throwing, sleeping in the house and chewing of paan. 
						<br>
						<h4> Agenda 1: AFSPA </h4>
						The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. This act grants 'special powers' to Indian armed forces, in what they term as 'disturbed areas'. AFSPA is invoked when a particular area goes out of control threatening security concerns of the common man and the state. The act allows officials to use any means necessary to control a situation, even if it means resorting to extreme force. An army official can fire upon you with mere suspicion. AFSPA has been criticized as being a tool of state abuse, oppression and discrimination and is said to encroach on basic fundamental rights. However, withdrawal of this act can give rise to terrorist activities and lead to an increase in the amount of conflict in that area. 
						<br>
						<h4> Agenda 2: Reservation </h4>
						Reservations refer to the privileges enjoyed by underrepresented groups in the Indian society such as women, scheduled casts and tribes and other backward classes. While this strives to provide equal opportunities to all members of the society, it is argued that it provides an unfair advantage to under qualified applicants. The fact that 50% of educational and job seats are reserved for these underrepresented groups implies that better qualified individuals are denied opportunities, which can affect the country as a whole in the long run.

                    		<h4>Agenda 1: Strengthening the Global Recovery and Lifting the Potential</h4>
							Despite the extraordinary measures taken globally, the recovery after the
							Great Recession is not as healthy as desired. Growth is sluggish and
							fragile, unemployment remains high and inequalities are on the rise.
							Lower confidence levels hinder consumption and investment. Therefore, in
							2015, discussions on the necessary policies to raise the pace of global
							growth will be conducted. These discussions will have a particular focus on
							macroeconomic policy cooperation among the G20 countries.
							In addition to that, we will strive to lift the growth potential of our
							economies. Our major instruments to this end will be boosting the
							investments, especially closing the infrastructure investment gaps,
							increasing employment and promoting trade, along with the appropriate
							macroeconomic policy mix. With that, the focus will be on the
							implementation of the policies set out in our ambitious growth strategies.
							<br>
							<h4> Agenda 2: Buttressing Sustainability </h4>						
							To buttress sustainability in the global economy as well as the environment, we will be focusing on
							the issues of development, energy, energy sustainability and climate change finance. Our
							central focus will be lifting prosperity across the globe, with a particular
							focus on supporting efforts to eradicate poverty and ensure sustainable
							development (in relation to the masses but more importantly the environment) in LEDC’s.

                    	 The Joint Action Committee (JAC) is the most unique committee this year and a new signature feature of Podar MUN, 2015. It is the most dynamic committee embroiled in perpetual conflict; wherein every  decision made by you delegates will have an immediate and effective role on the ongoing course of the committee.

						 <h4> Agenda 1: IC-814 Hijack </h4>
						 24th December 1999 - Indian Airlines flight IC-814, en route from Kathmandu to New Delhi has been hijacked. Taliban claims responsibility and asks for the release of three militants, Maulana Masood Azhar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar in exchange of the passengers on board. Delegates, you will represent high ranking officials from all parties involved and will race against time to come up with a viable solution keeping human rights, law and international relations in mind. 
						<br>
						<h4> Agenda 2: Indo-Pak War 1971 </h4>
						The country is in a state of war. Recent election results in Pakistan where the East Pakistani Awami League has won 167 of 169 seats in East Pakistan and secured a simple majority has caused massive unrest either side of the border.  Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rehman has presented the Six Points to the President of Pakistan and claimed the right to form the government. But the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, refuses to yield the premiership of Pakistan to Mujibur causing the President, Yahya Khan to call the military, dominated by West Pakistanis, to suppress dissent in East Pakistan.
						<br>
						3 December, 1971 :  Pakistan launched pre-emptive air strikes on 11 Indian airbases  causing India to retaliate. Gathered at the time of this war and chaos, the powerful and respected leaders of this committee must strive to find common ground and bring peace to this perilous sub-continent.
