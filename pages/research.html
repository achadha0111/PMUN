A position paper is essentially an essay which delineates your country’s/organization’s stand on the agenda. It helps you define the sequence for any ideas you may present in committee. This isn’t too difficult a task if you have researched your position well.
<br>
The chairs often ask for them a week prior to the conference in order to obtain an idea of the direction in which the discussion is headed. They also factor it in when making decisions about awarding best delegates. Your position paper should not only highlight your country’s policies but also suggest resolutions. A good starting off point is often the study guide that is provided by your selected committee.
<br>
Introduce your country and it’s historic relationship with the agenda and the committee.
Explain how the issue effects your country.
What policies pertain to this issue in your country and the justification for the same.
Facts and figures to substantiate your claims.
Previous UN conventions and resolutions signed or ratified by your country in relation to this issue.
Other UN policies supported by your country.
Recommendations for resolutions.
How does the position of other countries affect your country.

                    		Committee: International Labor Organization<br>
							Topic: Globalization and Development<br>
							Country: Romania<br>
							<br>
							In the past two decades the rapidly growing world trend has been toward globalization. With the emergence of the internet as a means of communication and the increasing accessibility of international trade physical barriers are not the only barriers withering away. Protective tariffs are plummeting and free trade agreements are becoming more prevalent. Romania appreciates that globalization creates favorable situations for expansion of commercial as well as economic assets. In the past year Romania has seen a foreign direct investment (FDI) increase of 199%. Inward FDI increased from EURO 234 million in 2005 to EURO 699 million in 2006. However, Romania realizes that increased globalization does not automatically produce more equality.
							<br>
							Globalization and Development can contribute to the advancement of the overall international human condition; however, the delegation of Romania recognizes that without proper regulation the potential for advancement will remain limited to an elite few individuals, businesses, and nations. Unless checked and aimed toward the common good, globalization cannot effectively serve the global community. Crucial in dealing with the complexities of globalization, good governance must act with solidarity and responsibility. Romania believes that in involving people in globalization we must promote moral values, democratic principals, inclusive global political culture, institutions that safeguard both individual civil rights and inherent freedoms, and the common good. In addition, coping with the influx of information from globalization governments must act with solidarity and insight. Access to digital education will undoubtedly result in the confidence of citizens in their respective administrations and allow for a greater degree of transparency, and therefore a lesser degree of corruption.
							<br>
							Romania believes the multinational business community has the ability and the obligation to support pertinent values in human rights, labor standards, and environmental preservation. As stated by the president, Mr. Traion Basescu, Romania feels a "heartfelt attachment to multilateralism, as an effective instrument designed to identify the adequate answers to the challenges brought by globalization."
							<br>
							Romania is party to the majority of multilateral treaties and conventions identified as such by the Secretary General in the context of the Millennium Summit in 2001. Romania has always supported innovative and effective ways of establishing cooperation within and between regional organizations. As one of the newest members of the European Union, Romania is an active member of the World Trade Organization, and looks forward to offering its support to the redirection of globalization to best benefit the global community.

                    		Making speeches is a critical part of the MUN. Generally, formal speeches will be required on 2 occasions: 
<ol>
<li>During the general speaker’s list</li>
<li>During formal debating.</li>
</ol>
<p>

It is imperative to be on point with your speeches in order to gain an upper hand during the committee sessions. The ability to persuade is a key trait required during the MUN. Not only must you appeal to the logical side of the argument but also attend to the feelings of others. Before any point can be made, it is necessary to get the attention of others. This should be followed by the use of appropriate oral and body language to maintain their attention and cause them to act upon your instructions. There will be many other speakers after you, your speech should remain ingrained in the mind of each delegate in the committee.
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Humour can be dangerous during serious discussions and might cause you to be frowned upon by other delegates and members of the EB.
<li>Try and have as much evidence for your cause as possible. By piling examples, you can influence other delegates into thinking that you are well prepared, even if you aren’t. However, caution must be observed, the credibility of your facts can be questioned and it may tarnish your reputation if the source is dubious.</li>
<li>Quotations and Quips: Very hand speaking tools, instant attention grabbers. Ensure that they are relevant and come from someone recognisable.
<li>At times, you may have only a minute to make your points clear, don’t beat around the bush.</li>
<li>If you forget, write down the key things you want to cover while you speak.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
<u>Maintain Attention:</u>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Statistics, examples and opinions of experts often makes people sit up and listen. Ensure statistics are up to date.</li>
<li>Explain how the problem affects various countries.</li>
<li>If needed, vividly explain how your opposition’s suggestions have issues in them.</li>
<li>When discussing solutions, be specific about how your proposals will be effective. Try and bring in references to similar previous solutions that have worked/worked to some extent.</li>
<li>Appeal for action at the end of your time. Try and summarise and or reiterate your stand.</li>

<p>
A resolution is a document that contains all the issues the committee tried to solve and proposed solutions. A resolution which hasn’t been voted upon is called a draft resolution. It only turns into a resolution once it is passed during voting bloc.
</p>
<p>
Any delegation can write a resolution. The lead author or the one who initiates the resolution writing is called a sponsor. Multiple delegations may sponsor a resolution if significant contributions have come in.
</p>
<p>
A resolution is typically written during unmoderated caucus. During this time you can collaborate with other delegates and try and incorporate the view of as many delegations as possible. Work on resolution usually begins after multiple debates have been held.
</p>
<p>
The resolution can be looked upon as the final aim of a committee. All the speeches, lobbying and teamwork should build up to this. The strength of a committee is often reflected by their ability to pass a resolution and it’s quality.
</p>
<p>
A resolution must be formatted in the following manner:
</p>
<u>Heading:</u>
<p>
    4 pieces of information:
<ol>
 <li>Committee Name </li>
 <li>Sponsors </li>
 <li>Signatories(delegations that don’t contribute yet
want to see the resolution debated) </li> 
<li>The topic</li>
</ol>
<p>
<u>Pre-ambulatory clauses:</u>

Contains all the issues the committee wants to resolve. Contains reasons why the committee is working on this issue and information on previous courses of action undertaken by the committee. A general layout would be:

<u>Underlined pre-ambulatory phrase</u> + statement + comma
</p>
<p>
<u>Operative clauses:</u>

Operative clauses states the solutions you have arrived at. It should address the issues specifically mentioned in the pre-ambulatory clauses above it.

A general format is:

Serial Number + Operative Clause phrase + solution + semi-colon(period in case of last clause)

You may have sub operative clauses to cover anything you think may not be adequately covered in your main clause.
</p>
<p>
<u>Amendments:</u>
<br>
Amendments are of two types:
<ol>
<li> Friendly: A change to the draft resolution that all sponsors agree with. It must be signed by all sponsors and approved by the committee chair.</li>
<li> Unfriendly amendment: A change not supported by all sponsors and requires voting. A certain number of signatories will be required to introduce it. Prior to voting on the draft resolution, the committee must vote on unfriendly amendments.</li>
</ol>
